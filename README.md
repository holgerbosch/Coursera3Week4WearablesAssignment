## Origin: either "train" or "test", depending on whether the observation originated from the test or training data sample
## Subject: value from 1 to 30, representing the subject of the measurement. a subject is either in the training or the test data set
## Remaining variables: all remaining variables are mean values per subject and activity for the different measurs 
## (all variables respresenting either a mean or a standard deviation measure of the originial data sampling)
